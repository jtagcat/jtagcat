Moved to a blog post draft. Mail me to remind me or to ask anything.

It seems that I frankly have more interesting to do.

The bio doesn't have git history, so let's plop it here as well:
```
A datahoarder, a tabhoarder, packaged in one.
Researching (any), critiquing (UX, design, psy), tinkering around (labbing), married to data, sound and language.
```
