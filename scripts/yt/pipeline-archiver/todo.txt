I, --playlist-items ITEM_SPEC  Comma separated playlist_index of the videos
                                to download. You can specify a range using
                                "[START]:[STOP][:STEP]". For backward
                                compatibility, START-STOP is also supported.
                                Use negative indices to count from the right
                                and negative STEP to download in reverse
                                order. E.g. "-I 1:3,7,-5::2" used on a
                                playlist of size 15 will download the videos
                                at index 1,2,3,7,11,13,15
