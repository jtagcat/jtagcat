### Nextcloud
They sell a product for an enterprise, yet it is unmaintainable in a one server one client situation (for file sync). Breaking bugs (such as Android app doesn't work at all) typically take half a year to fix. They roll out and force alpha-grade features they call beta on enterprise customers. They pack too much junk in to their product, core parts AND the junk don't tend to work. Using features they advertise before 2-3 years have passed can mean rolling back backups. They seem to do everything to break ~~userland~~ everything the user interacts with, they choose to hard-depend on deprecated or soon-to-be items.  
I'll avoid it whenever possible. Since they advertise so much, some things still choose to only integrate with Nextcloud.

### iPhone
I spent 6 months using it, it's just dumb. Even 'just works' things don't work.

#TODO: add iconnect scripts etc
